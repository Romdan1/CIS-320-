🛠️ Systems Analysis and Design Projects
This repository features selected projects from my Systems Analysis and Design course. Throughout the class, I learned how to plan, model, and design information systems using industry-standard techniques and tools.

Included in this collection are:

✅ Use Case Diagrams – to capture system functionality and user interactions

🔗 Traceability Matrix – to map requirements across various stages of development

🖼️ Prototypes – to visualize user interfaces and enhance design thinking

🔄 Sequence Diagrams – to model interactions between system components

🧩 Class Diagrams – to represent the structure and relationships of system objects

These projects demonstrate my ability to apply structured analysis and design methodologies to real-world scenarios, preparing me for systems development roles.
